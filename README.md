This is my first mini project on which I have been working from scratch on my own.

An idea for this application comes from frontendmentor.io

I was looking for a challenging mini project to test my current skills. So, I check out how app should look like and what functionalities should have.

About app.

This is a tool to manage invoices. There are possibilities to add, edit, change status, sort and delete invoice.

Technologies.

I used JavaScript, CSS and HTML. At the moment, to store data, I simply use the LocaleStorage.

The application is fully responsive and written using Model-View-Controller architecture.

In the right corner there is a button which will add four invoices. It makes much faster and simpler to check out how application works.
Have fun ;)
