This is my first mini project on which I have been working from scratch by myself.

An idea for this application comes from frontendmentor.io

I was looking for a challenging mini project to test my current skills. So, I check out how app should look like and what functionalities should have. I have changed some parts to have more fun.

About app.

This is a useful tool to manage invoices. There are possibilities to add, edit, change status, sort and delete invoice.

In the near future, I will try to:

- add documentation,
- organize whole architecture based on the Model–view–controller software design pattern, because right now I have one big file and divide into smaller modules will be so much better for adding new features,
- optimize code, because sometimes my solutions to specific problem are too complicated and some functions can be written with less code,
- add some functionalities such as change theme button, add third invoice type that will be draft, add some start/welcome page, disabled possibility to edit some information in the invoice which was paid.

Technologies.

I used JavaScript, CSS and HTML. At the moment, to store data, I simply use the LocaleStorage.

Application is fully responsive.

In the right corner there is a button which adds three invoices. It makes much faster and simpler to check out how application works. 
  Have fun ;) https://invoice-application.netlify.app/
